* Introduction
 In ophthalmology there are many tests that can perform in a non invasive way. In order to do that automatically we will use a smartphone to perform a psychophysical tests.

 We can control the intensity of a point in the screen of smartphone by absolute values, but we want this values in a standard measurement unit, wich is commonly used by professionals of this field.

 This report will describe how we made our experiment and show some results got.

* Method
 We used a device called luximetry to get measurements of a point's intensities in the screen. In order to block the light from outside, we built a small paperboard box and we painted it inside with black color to minimize possible effects light reflectance.

 The point area painted in the screen was measured in 3 different sizes, with diameters of 300, 200 and 100 millimeters.

* Results
